For this to work in TypeScript, we'll use SQLite via better-sqlite3 or sqlite3, and you'll need to ensure a TypeScript setup capable of running Node.js code.

Key Changes:
1. SQLite Module: Uses sqlite3 with TypeScript for database operations.
2. TypeScript Types: Added types like Record<string, { total: number; wins: number }> for group statistics.
3. Arrow Functions: Used modern TypeScript/JavaScript syntax for callbacks and better readability.
4. Error Handling: Included error checks for database queries.

Prerequisites:
1. Install dependencies: npm install sqlite3
2. Ensure TypeScript is installed: npm install -g typescript
3. Compile the script: tsc analyzegrp.ts
4. Run the script: node analyzegrp.js
