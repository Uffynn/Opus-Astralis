Key Points:

1. SQLite Operations:
- Used the sqlite3 module's run method to execute the DELETE query.
- this.changes provides the number of rows affected by the query.

2. Error Handling:
- Errors are logged if the database operation fails.
- The changes property of the callback function checks if the DELETE operation affected any rows.

3. Command-Line Arguments:
- Used process.argv.slice(2) to parse command-line arguments.
- Validates that exactly one argument (the contract address) is provided.

4. TypeScript Type Safety:
- Ensures that the ca parameter is always a string.

Prerequisites:
1. Install sqlite3: npm install sqlite3
2. Compile the script: tsc removewatch.ts
3. Run the script with a contract address: node removewatch.js
